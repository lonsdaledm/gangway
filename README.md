# Gangway

The quickest way to get on board with all the tools you need (we think).

## Running the Script

### Pre-requisites

- mac OS
- [Ansible](ansible.com)

To install Ansible, you can follow the directions [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) or run `brew install ansible` if HomeBrew is already installed (if it's not, this Ansible playbook will install HomeBrew for you).
